The 8 Week SQL Challenge is proudly brought to you by the Data With Danny virtual data apprenticeship program to celebrate the launch of the Serious SQL course!

<h2> What is the 8 Week SQL Challenge? </h2>

My idea was to create a online community which supports all data professionals who were specifically starting on their SQL learning journey.

I also wanted to help everyone start crafting their own personal branding, online presence and a personal portfolio of data projects - and so the 8 Week SQL Challenge was born!

For the next 8 weeks - I challenge you to:

Dedicate yourself to learning SQL
Share regular updates on social media about what you are learning
Get started on your own GitHub Pages personal website and project portfolio
How can I get started with the challenge?

Share an update on LinkedIn using the dedicated #8WeekSQLChallenge hashtag
Start solving the 8 Week SQL Challenge case studies
Here’s an example post you could share on LinkedIn - please feel free to improvise and personalise your post as much as you like!

<h2> I’m ready to start the challenge - what should I learn first? </h2>

There is no one single correct answer for this question but here are a few suggestions!
